This is a boilerplate project that consists of

1. Meteor JS - Javascript Framework that is Isomorphic

2. React JS - The V in MVC

3. Webpack - Module loader.

Using this boilerplate you will be able to use...

ES2015 Module Import Syntax
Many of the great NPM modules out there for the React Ecosystem
No Blaze UI which is great :)
React Router to do code splitting. That way you don't serve your whole JS bundle to clients.

Enjoy!
